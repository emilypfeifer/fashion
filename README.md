# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks with Keras

The jupyter notebook for this project can be found [here.](https://github.com/emilypfeifer/fashion/blob/master/study.ipynb)

The blog post for this project can be found [here.](https://pfeiferem.weebly.com/image-classification-with-fashion-mnist.html)

## The Data
The Fashion M-NIST is a dataset created by Zalando Research that consists of 70,000 28x28 greyscale images of articles of clothing. Each example belongs to one of ten classes. The data for this project can be downloaded directly from Zalando's github for the Fashion M-NIST [here.](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)

## Goal

The goal for this project was to develop a model that can correctly identify what article of clothing an image in the dataset displays.

## Deep Learning
In the notebook, I walk through the development of creating my own convolutional neural network as well as using Data Augmentation to improve my model's performance. Upon completion of the CNN, I use a variety of techniques to evaluate my model's strengths and weaknesses, from confusion matrices to visualizing activation layers.
