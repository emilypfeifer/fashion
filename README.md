# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks with Keras
## The Data
The Fashion M-NIST is a dataset created by Zalando Research that consists of 70,000 28x28 greyscale images of articles of clothing. Each example belongs to one of ten classes.  
## Goal

The goal for this project was to develop a model that can correctly identify what article of clothing an image in the dataset displays.

## Deep Learning
In the notebook, I walk through the development of creating my own convolutional neural network as well as using Data Augmentation to improve my model's performance. Upon completion of the CNN, I use a variety of techniques to evaluate my model's strengths and weaknesses, from confusion matrices to visualizing activation layers.
